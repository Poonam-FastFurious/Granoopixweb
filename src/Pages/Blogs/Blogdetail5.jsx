                    AR is a technology that overlays digital contentâ€”such as
                    images, videos, or 3D modelsâ€”onto the real world through
                    devices like smartphones, tablets, or AR glasses. Unlike
                    Virtual Reality (VR), which immerses users in a completely
                    digital environment, AR enhances the physical world, making
                    interactions more engaging and informative. In today's
                    rapidly evolving digital landscape, the United Arab Emirates
                    (UAE) stands at the forefront of technological innovation,
                    particularly in the realm of Augmented Reality (AR). Recent
                    studies indicate that by 2025, approximately 65% of the
                    UAE's population is expected to adopt AR, underscoring its
                    growing significance in daily life.
