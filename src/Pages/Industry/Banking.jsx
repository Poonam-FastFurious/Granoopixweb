          "Augmented Reality (AR) is revolutionizing the online shopping experience for both customers and businesses by seamlessly blending digital and physical worlds. For customers, AR offers a unique try before you buy experience, allowing them to visualize products like furniture, dÃ©cor, or gadgets in their own environment before making a purchase. This interactive preview helps eliminate uncertainty, boosting buyer confidence and ensuring that expectations align with reality. As a result, customers feel more satisfied with their purchase decisions, leading to fewer returns and higher trust in the brand. For businesses, AR enhances the shopping journey by creating a more engaging and personalized experience, which not only attracts customers but also drives higher conversion rates. By reducing returns and increasing customer satisfaction, AR technology becomes a powerful tool for businesses to foster long-term loyalty and growth in an increasingly competitive e-commerce landscape"
